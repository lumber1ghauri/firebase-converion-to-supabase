/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for GlamBook Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for client and appointment data,
 * ensuring that each user can only access their own data. Makeup service data is public.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Stores client information, accessible only by the owner.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment
 *   information, also accessible only by the owner.
 * - /makeup_services/{makeupServiceId}: Stores public makeup service data, accessible to all.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for all client and appointment data.
 * - Makeup service data is publicly readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'clientId' and 'userId' are part of the document path for clients and appointments,
 *   eliminating the need for additional 'get()' calls to verify ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data (clients, appointments) is stored under /users/{userId} to enforce
 *   private access. Public data (makeup services) is stored in a top-level collection.
