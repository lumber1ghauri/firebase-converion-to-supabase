    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the GlamBook Pro application, focusing on appointment booking and quote generation for makeup services. The structure leverages path-based ownership for user-related data (Clients, Appointments, Quotes) to ensure data isolation and simplified security rules. Services are stored in a top-level collection as they are global and shared across all clients. \n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** The structure enforces authorization independence by avoiding hierarchical `get()` calls in security rules. Client IDs are stored directly within Appointment and Quote documents. This denormalization allows security rules to validate ownership without needing to traverse up the document hierarchy.\n*   **Segregation:** All documents within the Client, Service, Appointment, and Quote collections will have the same security requirements.\n*   **QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The use of path-based ownership for Clients, Appointments, and Quotes ensures that listing operations can be securely performed. Security rules can efficiently filter data based on the `request.auth.uid` without having to inspect the data itself.\n*   **Invariants:** The structure supports invariants by placing related data (Appointments, Quotes) under the ownership of a specific client. This ensures that only the client (or authorized personnel) can access and modify their own data.\n\nThis structure optimizes for a secure, scalable, and debuggable system, aligned with the application's requirements."
